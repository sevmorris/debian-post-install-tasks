### MY Debian Post-Install Tasks
---

1. This is my Debian post-install task list. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

2. My Debian post-install task list is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

3. My Debian post-install task list, without me, is useless. Without my Debian post-install task list, I am useless.

<br>
Change Oh My Bash theme to my preference (Zork):

```console
sed -i 's/font/zork/g' ~/.bashrc
```

<br>
Append some things to the bottom of .bashrc (paste and execute the entire code block below):<br>

_Due credit to [Mako-Wish](https://askubuntu.com/users/885743/mako-wish) for the [update alias](https://askubuntu.com/questions/118025/bypass-the-yes-no-prompt-in-apt-get-upgrade/1305901#1305901)_

```console
cat >> ~/.bashrc << EOL

# A rather comprehensive update alias:
alias update='sudo apt update && sudo apt -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confdef" dist-upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y && if sudo test -f /var/run/reboot-required; then read -p "A reboot is required to finish installing updates. Press [ENTER] to reboot now, or [CTRL+C] to cancel and reboot later." && sudo reboot; else echo "A reboot is not required. Exiting..."; fi'

# The text after figlet is displayed as an ASCII text banner, so change it as desired...
figlet Debian!
echo "" # Just to add a little space bellow the banner

neofetch
EOL
```

Create a file to suppress the boot message/warning:

```console
touch ~/.hushlogin
```

Reload .bashrc

```console
source ~/.bashrc
```
